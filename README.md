Trying to find insights and findings using the Human Resource Dataset (20k+ Rows) by considering turnover rates, race-age-gender distribution, and much more with the help of MySQL Workbench and PowerBI. 

#### Some defined set of problem sets are: 
* What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company?
* What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees in the company?
* What is the age distribution of employees in the company?
* How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?
* What is the average length of employment for employees who have been terminated?
* How does the gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
* What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
* Which department has the highest turnover rate?
* What is the distribution of employees across locations by state?
* How has the company's employee count changed based on hire and term dates?
* What is the tenure distribution for each department?
